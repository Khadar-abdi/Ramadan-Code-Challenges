# Ramadan Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Ramadan Code Challenges**! This is a community-driven challenge where weâ€™ll be solving programming problems each week. The goal is to build problem-solving skills, improve coding abilities, and have fun while doing it.

## How It Works

Each week, a set of coding challenges will be provided. Youâ€™ll have to solve these problems using your preferred programming language. After you solve a challenge, you will submit your solution to the GitHub repository under the corresponding week folder.

### **Folder Structure:**

- Each week will have its own folder (e.g., `Week-1`, `Week-2`, etc.).
- Inside the folder for each week, please submit your solution file.
  - **Naming your solution:** Name your file using your **username** followed by `-solution` (e.g., `john-doe-solution.js` or `maria-smith-solution.py`).

Example folder structure:

```
Ramadan-Code-Challenges/
â”œâ”€â”€ Week-1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution-john-doe.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution-maria-smith.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ solution-james-brown.js
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### **How to Submit:**

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create your solution inside the corresponding **week folder**.
4. **Push** your solution back to your fork.
5. **Make a Pull Request** to the main repository.

## Rules & Guidelines

### **1. No AI Tools Allowed:**

This challenge is designed to train your brain and enhance your problem-solving skills. While itâ€™s okay to **google** for hints or learn about a concept, **DO NOT use AI tools** to generate the solution for you. **The best way to grow is to try, fail, and try again.**

**Remember:**

> "Try, fail, again try, and get it!" ğŸ’¡

### **2. Full Explanation Required:**

Once youâ€™ve solved the problem, **write an explanation** of your approach. Share what worked, what didnâ€™t, and how you came to your final solution.

#### **Explanation Format:**

- **Understanding the Problem**: Describe what the challenge is asking for.
- **Breaking It Down**: What logic did you use to approach the solution?
- **Code Walkthrough**: Explain each part of your code.
- **Alternative Approaches**: Did you think of other ways to solve the problem? Share them!

### **3. Discord Hints Channel:**

If you get stuck, donâ€™t worry! We have a **dedicated Discord channel** called **#stuck-on-code** where you can ask for **hints**. Remember, no full solutions will be shared here. Weâ€™re all about learning and supporting each other.

## Motivation

Solving programming problems can be challenging, but donâ€™t get discouraged! **The goal is not just to solve the problem**, but to learn from the experience and grow as a developer. The more you practice, the better youâ€™ll get.
